Written by Oracle experts, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure thoroughly illuminates OCI features and tools for developing modern cloud-scale applications. Each feature is explored with relevant, practical examples, and the authors walk through integrating them into an abroad microservice-based, container-native application that fully leverages OCI. You won't just understand OCI services; you'll discover how to leverage them in nuanced ways to build, deploy, and manage modern cloud-native applications with exceptional performance, agility, and scalability. Coverage includes:

* Automating and managing infrastructure with maximum efficiency and flexibility
* Deploying cloud-native services on OCI
* Using Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes
* Building and delivering serverless applications
* Ensuring observability in OCI environments
* Securing workloads and infrastructure
